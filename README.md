# stock_analysis

## Overview of Project

**Purpose**

The purpose of the project was to provide Steve with a way to quickly generate an analysis of the stock data for a specific year.

This project will compare a few other green energy stocks with DQ and output the total volume of each stock and their performance. This information will be represented using Excel's Visual Basic Application (VBA).

The image above indicates the results for 2017 yearly performance. As we could see market soared except for TERP symbol.

Image above shows market's performance in 2018. Generally speaking we could tell market tendency reverted from a previous year with only two symbols ending up with gains.

Speaking about difference in macros performance between original and refactored scripts, after running both versions for 2017 and 2018 we observe hat the run time of refactored scripts from both 2017 and 2018 was faster than the original scripts. The refactored script is roughly 0.05 seconds faster.

**Original Script Times:**
